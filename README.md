JUCE Plugin Synth with Anti-Aliasing
===============

This code implements a modification of the JUCE plugin example which adds minblep-based antialiasing to the synth. 

For an explanaition of this implementation, see the blog: [Modern Bandwidth Limiting for Synths](http://www.stagecraftsoftware.com/advanced-features/modern-bandwidth-limiting-for-synths/). 

For technical details of this method, see Eli Brandt of CMU's paper on the minblep technique: [Hard Sync Without Aliasing](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~eli/papers/icmc01-hardsync.pdf).
